# Movie Recommender App

## Description

The Movie Recommender App is a Python-based application that provides personalized movie recommendations using a content-based filtering approach. By analyzing movie features and user preferences, the app suggests movies that are similar to those the user has shown interest in. The recommendations are generated using cosine similarity, which measures the similarity between movie feature vectors.

### Features:
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Recommends movies based on the content of the movies themselves (e.g., genre, plot keywords) and user preferences.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Utilizes cosine similarity to compare movie features and find the closest matches to user preferences.
- **User Interface**: Provides an interactive interface for users to input their preferences and view personalized recommendations.
- **Data Integration**: Uses movie datasets (e.g., TMDb) to retrieve movie details and feature information.
